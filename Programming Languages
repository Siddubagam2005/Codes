/*Programming Languages
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
Ram is a software developer, so he has to switch between different languages sometimes. Each programming language has some features, which are represented by integers here. Currently, Ram has to use a language with two given features A and B. He has two options --- switching to a language with two features A1​ and B1​, or to a language with two features A2​ and B2​. All four features of these two languages are pairwise distinct. Tell Ram whether he can use the first language, the second language or neither of these languages (if no single language has all the required features).

Input
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers A, B, A1, B1, A2, B2 respectively.

Constraints
1 ≤ A, B, A1, B1, A2, B2 ≤ 4
A and B are distinct
A1,B1,A2,B2 re pairwise distinct.
Output
Return a single line containing the integer 1 if Ram should switch to the first language, or 2  if Ram should switch to the second language, or 0 if Ram cannot switch to either language.
Example
Sample Input
1 2 2 1 3 4
Sample Output
1
Explanation
The first language has the required features --- features 1 and 2.*/

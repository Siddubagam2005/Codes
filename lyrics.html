Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah

Wait a minute, uh, get it how you live it, uh
Ten toes in when we standin' on bidness
I'm a big stepper, underground methods
Top-notch hos get the most, not the lesser (the most, not the lesser)
Straight terror, product of your errors
Pushin' culture, baby, got that product you can't measure (product you can't measure)
Trendsetter, the one who get her wetter
Swervin' while I'm bumpin' Project Pat, uh

Yeah, rollin' through the city with the big dawgs
Fuck the laws, lawyer with me, we ain't gotta call
Celly on silent, but the product end up hella loud
That's how you make the money pile for everyone involved

And if you don't deserve a cut, then we gon' cut 'em off (cut 'em off)
My barber got me lookin' proper every single time
Fresh fade, gettin' faded on that top grade
No, you ain't walkin' out alive smokin' what we on

And you know I gotta pour it for the ones who gone (gone)
R.I.P., it's in your memory, we carry on
When I die, they will not bury me, not what I want
Burn my body, pour my ashes in a river, y'all

That's how we knowin' that the flow 'bout to carry on
See, immortality's a fallacy, I prove 'em wrong
The southern family gon' carry me to way beyond
Anything you've ever known, anything you've done

They ask me, "How you be like this?" (Huh, what?)
"How you live like this?" (What, what, what?)
Why you worried 'bout it, ho? Get up off my dick (get up off my dick)
Get up out the way (get up out the way)

What you think this is? (What you think this is?)
No, we ain't worried 'bout it, ho, watch me skrrt the whip
They ask me, "How you get like this?" (Huh, what?)
"How you live like this?" (Huh, what?)
Why you worried 'bout it, ho? Get up off my dick (get up off my dick)
Get up out the way (get up out the way)

What you think this is? (What you think this is?)
No, we ain't worried 'bout you, ho, watch me skrrt the whip, yeah
Yeah, swervin', movin' to the money like it's urgent
Hands on guy, so I'm in it like a surgeon (like a surgeon)
Uh, the skin color like the bourbon
A worldwide sign that we face closed curtains (closed curtains)
Out here, yo, nothin' ever certain

Only thing that's promised is that promises are broken (promises are broken)
Yeah, so we findin' ways to cope then
Only thing I'm breakin' is her back with the motions, ooh
Yeah, baby girl, bring out the goodies
Snuck it in inside her hoodie, now we turnin'  to boogie, yeah
In school, I used to fight the bullies

Now I'm fightin' with the law, guess some things don't leave you fully (yessir)
They try and push me, then they try and uppull me
Bet I will not budge, if you doubt it, then just call my bookie
And my bookie takin' bets
Prophesize a profit when you know what's comin' next like, ooh
Yeah, baby girl, bring out the goodies
Snuck it in inside her hoodie, now we turnin' up to boogie, yeah
In school, I used to fight the bullies

Now I'm fightin' with the law, guess some things don't leave you fully
They try and push me, then they try and pull me
Bet I will not budge, if you doubt it, then just call my bookie
And my bookie takin' bets
Prophesize a profit when you know what's comin' next like, uh
Money on my mind, we gon' run it up

See what you gon' find, baby, push your luck
We been on the grind, we been gettin' up
We ain't got the time for you fuckin' bums
Money on my mind, we gon' run it up
